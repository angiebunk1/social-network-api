# social-network-api

## Description

This is the backend API for a social network. Users can create, read, update, and delete profiles and posts. They can also add or remove friends from their friends list, and add or remove reactions to posts.

This is not a deployed application and it has no front end. The functional API routes can be viewed here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kp9_RlfqPxngRzZ9xGaJmwp4Gpg05XfW/view?usp=sharing .

## Usage

Since this isn't a deployed application, the user would need to download the files and install the required packages to use it. First the server must be started, then the routes can be tested in Insomnia.

Here are some screenshots of starting the server and testing the routes:
